# Misspecified ECE
```{R}

## Non-Stationary Covariance 
```{R}
# Covariance Changes Halfway Through Sequence
S1 <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 2)
S2 <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1), nrow = 2)

# Simulate Scenario
sims <- map_dbl(1:n_sims, ~ {
  # Generate Data
  X <- rbind(
    MASS::mvrnorm(n / 2, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = S1),
    MASS::mvrnorm(n / 2, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = S2)
  )
  # Get Estimate
  ece.test(X[, 1], X[, 2])$estimate
})

# Aggregate Results
sims %>% mean()
sims %>%
  t.test() %>%
  .$conf.int
```

### Analysis/Observations
My guess is that when the correlation changes over time, ECE will give you the average of them. For example, in the above simulation, half of the data points had a true correlation of 0 and the other half had a correlation of 0.5. On average, ECE produced an estimate right in the middle: 0.25. 

This is unsurprising considering we take lagged differences, and each lagged difference is an instance of correlation estimation.
